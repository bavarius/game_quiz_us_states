<h1>US-States Quiz</h1>
<p><br>Quiz game where the user has to type in the names of all 50 US-states, coded in python as brought to me inside udemy course "100 Days of Python".
<p>The game either ends when the user hit the cancel button or all state names have been entered correctly.
A list of not guessed state names is generated at the end of the game. (states_to_learn.csv)</p>
<p>The current implementation uses turtle graphics.</p>
